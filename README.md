# Password Generator

## Overview
The Password Generator is a simple Python-based tool that generates strong and random passwords for users. It allows users to specify the desired password length and ensures the generated password is both secure and meets complexity requirements.

---

## Features
- **User-Friendly Input**: Users can specify the desired password length through a simple input prompt.
- **Strong Passwords**: Ensures passwords contain a mix of:
  - Uppercase and lowercase letters
  - Digits (0-9)
  - Special characters (e.g., `@`, `#`, `$`)
- **Randomized Output**: Passwords are randomly generated, with shuffled characters for added security.
- **Error Handling**: Provides validation for incorrect or invalid inputs, such as non-numeric values or lengths shorter than 4.
